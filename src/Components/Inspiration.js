              <p style={{fontSize: '24px'}}className="card-text">During our time as students in middle school,
                    we observed that teachers had to rotate computer carts among classes and not every student was able to afford a laptop to bring to school. 
                    This practice often hindered student's learning, as they were unable to use laptops for any online work. Not only did this hinder students' learning. Which is why Techcore would like to create a difference in schools by providing laptops to classrooms, so every student has access to technology. With your support, we can turn this into a reality.   </p>
